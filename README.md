# Final-project_-811
# Project Name: Bacterial Genome Assembly
    Group Members: Popy Rani Debi, Ramesh JayaKumar
# Background
     - We are using Illumina Hiseq 2500, paired-end, 250 bp sequencing reads.
     - There are two files per sample, the forward and reverse reads in FASTQ format.
     - The project's goal is to reconstruct the raw sequence data at chromosome-level resolution.
